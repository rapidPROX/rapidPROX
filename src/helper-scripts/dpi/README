The scripts in this directory characterize flow a DPI-enabled VNF. The
characeterization is split up into two steps. The first step (dpi1.py)
searches for the traffic profile parameter boundaries. The second step
(dpi2.py) takes as input the output of the first step and searches for
the maximum sustainable throughput of a DPI-enabled VNF.

To run the first script, use:

   python2.7 ./dpi1.py -t TEST_SYSTEM_DESCRIPTIONS -o OUTPUT1

TEST_SYSTEM_DESCRIPTIONS is a comma-separated list of systems where
the syntax of defining each system is shown below:

   user@ip:proxDir:cfgDir

To run the second script, use:

   python2.7 ./dpi2.py -t TEST_SYSTEM_DESCRIPTIONS \
   	     -s SYSTEM_UNDER_TEST_DESCRIPTIONS \
	     -o OUTPUT2 -d \
	     -i OUTPUT1

Finally, the results can be processed using the following command:

   python2.7 ./maketable.py -i OUTPUT1 -j OUTPUT2 -o FINAL_TABLE
