While it is possible to manually run stateful traffic generation as
described below, it is recommended to use the provided dpi scripts
available in the help-scripts directory..

Before running flow based generation, a traffic profile needs to be
extracted and copied into this directory. This is done by running the
flow extract tool. An example of running the tool is shown below. For
more details on the flow extract tool, please read the provided help
by running the tool with the -h argument.

./build/flowextract2 -s 500000 -i input.pcap -o output_directory

After the output has been copied to this directory, the configuration
can be launched as shown below:

./build/prox -f flow_gen/flow_gen_4ports.cfg -e \
	     -q max_setup_rate=2000 \
	     -q connections=50000 \
	     -q ss=19.46 \
	     -q test_system_id=0

The parameters provided through -q depend on the traffic profile. The
following command can be used to find the maximum value of ss:

./build/prox -f flow_gen/flow_gen_4ports.cfg -e \
	     -q max_ss_and_quit=true \
	     -q test_system_id=0

This will cause prox to read the traffic profile, calculate the maximum
value and quit immediately. No packets will be sent and the value for
ss will be printed on stdout.
